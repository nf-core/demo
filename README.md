## Introduction

**nf-core/demo** is a simple nf-core style bioinformatics pipeline for workshops and demonstrations. It was created using the nf-core template and is designed to run quickly using small test data files.

![nf-core/demo metro map](docs/images/nf-core-demo-subway.png)

1. Read QC ([`FASTQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
2. Adapter and quality trimming ([`SEQTK_TRIM`](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk))
3. Present QC for raw reads ([`MULTIQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
SAMPLE1_PE,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/viralrecon/illumina/amplicon/sample1_R1.fastq.gz,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/viralrecon/illumina/amplicon/sample1_R2.fastq.gz
SAMPLE2_PE,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/viralrecon/illumina/amplicon/sample2_R1.fastq.gz,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/viralrecon/illumina/amplicon/sample2_R2.fastq.gz
SAMPLE3_SE,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/viralrecon/illumina/amplicon/sample1_R1.fastq.gz,
SAMPLE3_SE,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nf-core/test-datasets/viralrecon/illumina/amplicon/sample2_R1.fastq.gz,
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/demo \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/demo/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/demo/parameters).

## Pipeline output

To see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/demo/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.
